build all the code for a telegram bot that shows which wallets buying and selling the Solana token with contract address 7TTcLchHbXz5fQqbBcoWi1Zen87AiziaqFCrf9Enpump are mevs



- make it into one page of code i can copy and paste into botfather without the need to download anything

## Project Plan
```
Here’s a **simple and clear project plan** to build the Telegram bot for identifying wallets buying/selling the Solana token and detecting MEV activity. The plan is divided into **main tasks** and includes **technical considerations** for each step.

---

## **Project Plan**

### **1. Project Setup**
- **Tasks**:
  1. Create a Telegram bot using BotFather and obtain the API token.
  2. Set up the development environment (e.g., Python or Node.js).
  3. Initialize a Git repository for version control.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use `python-telegram-bot` (Python) or `node-telegram-bot-api` (Node.js) for Telegram bot integration.
  - Ensure the environment has the required libraries installed (e.g., `solana-py`, `requests`, `websockets`).

---

### **2. Telegram Bot Development**
- **Tasks**:
  1. Implement basic bot commands (`/start`, `/help`, `/check_mev`).
  2. Set up a message handler to process user inputs.
  3. Add error handling for invalid commands or inputs.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use asynchronous programming for real-time updates.
  - Store the bot token securely (e.g., environment variables).

---

### **3. Solana Blockchain Integration**
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use the Solana JSON RPC API or `solana-py`/`solana-web3.js` to fetch transaction data.
  2. Filter transactions involving the token contract address `7TTcLchHbXz5fQqbBcoWi1Zen87AiziaqFCrf9Enpump`.
  3. Parse transaction details (e.g., wallet addresses, timestamps, amounts).
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use WebSocket subscriptions or polling for real-time transaction monitoring.
  - Handle Solana API rate limits by implementing retries and rate-limiting logic.

---

### **4. MEV Detection Logic**
- **Tasks**:
  1. Define heuristics for MEV detection:
     - High gas fees.
     - Rapid succession of transactions.
     - Specific transaction types (e.g., swaps, arbitrage).
  2. Implement basic detection algorithms.
  3. Test the logic with sample transaction data.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Start with simple heuristics and refine over time.
  - Consider using machine learning models for advanced detection in future iterations.

---

### **5. Output Formatting and Messaging**
- **Tasks**:
  1. Format the detected MEV activity into a readable message.
  2. Include details like wallet addresses, transaction timestamps, and flagged MEV behavior.
  3. Send the formatted message to the user via Telegram.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use Markdown or HTML formatting for better readability in Telegram messages.
  - Ensure sensitive information (e.g., wallet balances) is not exposed.

---

### **6. Real-Time Monitoring**
- **Tasks**:
  1. Set up continuous monitoring of the Solana blockchain for new transactions.
  2. Trigger MEV detection logic for each new transaction.
  3. Send real-time updates to users if MEV activity is detected.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use WebSocket subscriptions for real-time updates.
  - Implement a queue system to handle high transaction volumes.

---

### **7. Deployment**
- **Tasks**:
  1. Host the bot on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku, Google Cloud).
  2. Ensure the bot runs continuously and handles updates in real-time.
  3. Set up logging and monitoring for debugging and performance tracking.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use a process manager like `PM2` (Node.js) or `systemd` (Python) to keep the bot running.
  - Implement health checks and auto-restart mechanisms.

---

### **8. Testing and Optimization**
- **Tasks**:
  1. Test the bot with real-world transactions to validate MEV detection accuracy.
  2. Optimize the bot for performance and scalability.
  3. Gather user feedback and refine the bot’s functionality.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use testnet transactions for initial testing to avoid costs.
  - Monitor API usage and optimize for rate limits.

---

### **9. Documentation and Maintenance**
- **Tasks**:
  1. Document the bot’s functionality, commands, and usage instructions.
  2. Set up a maintenance plan for updates and bug fixes.
  3. Plan for future enhancements (e.g., advanced MEV detection, additional blockchain support).
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use tools like Sphinx (Python) or JSDoc (Node.js) for code documentation.
  - Regularly update dependencies to ensure security and compatibility.
